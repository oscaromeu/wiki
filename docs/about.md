This wiki contains notes regarding things I have learned

Each note will provide a summary of the most important points regarding the topic. This is useful for getting a higher-level understanding or refreshing your memory. If you want more details, you can use the resources at the end of the note as a curated list of resources.

## Contributing

Some goals I had when creating these notes:

+ Allow me to quickly get back up to speed on a subject that I investigated before
Help me structure my thoughts as I am learning new things
+ In order for those goals to be achieved, it's important that I am the only one writing these notes. Therefore, I will not accept any contributions to the repository (with the exception of minor spelling, grammar and attribution fixes).

If you want to build upon my work, feel free to fork the repository   or use the text in any other way while providing proper attribution (a link to this website or the repository is sufficient).
